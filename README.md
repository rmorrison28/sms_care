# SMS Care

This is a project for the [SMS Care organization](http://www.sms-care.org) dedicated _to eliminate all preventable disease in sub-saharan africa_.

This software is made it for intent to have a continous communication channel, used for intercept messages and respond automatically.

We're using an android software called [SMSsync](http://smssync.ushahidi.com)
 to transform the device in a local sms gateway, and handle the messages.

The current software is in beta versi√≥n, and just has a few features:

- Receive the messages intercepted by the device to store it.
- Respond the message with another custom message, provided by the _intelligence_(a simple text file with messages codes).
- Have a list of custom messages based on codes.
- Show the list of the received messages.

The next features are:

- Schedule the send of messages
- Have a history of an entire conversation

So, for more information about the use and the contribution, please read the Wiki.

This project was built in the last [MECATE](http://let-emprendimientopublico.mx/es/mecate/) event in Mexico City.
